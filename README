This project includes all the files/directories needed to use the web app to find nearby Wikipedia articles given a client's
location (laptop, desktop or mobile).  The articles are then plotted using Google Maps with custom markers.

Download all files/directories to your favority LAMP stack installation dir.  None of this code requires a DB, so you 
don't really need MySql.

The index.php file contains one big button which starts the process of locating and mapping the client and the articles.
The nearby_search.php file contains code to locate the client and then calls the map_nearby_articles.php code to 
perform the search and map the results onto Google maps.
The img directory contains the marker images for the articles as well as the big button image.

This code is open source - so feel free to modify and share.  It was written in approximately 2.5 hours at the Wikipedia
hackathon in SF on January 21/22 (sans network issues and hardware issues etc.).  The marker images were created by 
Rosemary Mckeon.  The design for the Wikipedia article marker was done by me.
